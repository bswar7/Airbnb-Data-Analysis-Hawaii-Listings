## Description

This project explores Airbnb listings in Hawaii using Excel.
The goal was to identify key patterns in listings, property types, and estimated revenue.
The dataset was cleaned, analyzed, and visualized through Pivot Tables and Charts to uncover insights about the Airbnb market in Hawaii.

## Data Cleaning

- Removed unnecessary and irrelevant columns such as URLs, long text descriptions, host images, and redundant location data to simplify the dataset.

- Converted all price values from text to numeric format for accurate analysis and calculations.

- Identified and removed extreme outliers (prices above $5000) to ensure realistic results.

- Handled missing, duplicate, or blank values across key columns like price, number_of_reviews, and review_scores_rating.

- Standardized data types and reformatted columns for easier use in Pivot Tables.

- Created a final clean version of the dataset with only essential and well-structured information ready for analysis.
